      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>Medicaid members had no easy way to access their case information. If they needed to ask a question or update some basic info, they would have to call and wait on hold for up to an hour, sometimes longer. The Medicaid members were also always not
        using desktop computers as much as they were using smartphones. So they needed to have a way to access all of their Medicaid information from their smartphone. </p>



      <h2>User Research and Personas</h2>
      <p>During the beginning of the project, I conducted user research by creating a survey that was sent out to 100+ State of Colorado Medicaid clients. I analyzed the data and based on our results created personas. I uncovered the current experience for
        managing your Medicaid through the State's website was confusing and difficult for the majority of the Medicaid clients that responded to the survey. The State of Colorado Medicaid users desired a simple way to manage their families insurance
        while on the go. Almost all of the participants that responded carried a smart phone. This helped us determine that we needed to build native applications as well as a responsive website, ensuring that the entire population would have access to
        the PEAKHealth experience.</p>

      <h2>User Flows</h2>
      <p>The PEAKHealth mobile app is a complex experience with lots of paths and flows for the user to interact with. It was crucial for the success of the team for me to diagram out not only the apps informational architecture but also the features that
        would be implemented for each sprint. These user flow diagrams helped the team understand where the new features would be implemented for each sprint cycle during development.</p>

      </div>
      <!-- end portfolio image -->

      <h2>Wireframe Sketches</h2>
      <p>For the majority of the projects that I work on, I create sketches of the wireframes, usually on a whiteboard and in my notebook. Sketching is one of the most critical parts of my process because it is a quick way to test ideas, flows and interactions.
      </p>

      </div>
      <!-- end portfolio image -->


      <h2>iOS Wireframes</h2>
      <p>I created all the wireframes for the PEAKHealth iOS application. For each platform, there were hundreds of screens. Using the tool Sketch, I was able to organize my wireframes based on features for each sprint. This made finding screens that were
        created early in the project easy to find when I needed to reference them at the end of the project.</p>

      <h2>Android Wireframes</h2>
      <p>I created all the wireframes for the PEAKHealth Android application.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <!-- portfolio image -->

      <h2>Responsive Web Wireframes</h2>
      <p>I created all the wireframes for the PEAKHealth Responsive application.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <!-- portfolio image -->
        <img src="img/peakhealth/peakhealth_responsive.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Peak Health Responsive Wireframes">

      </div>
      <!-- end portfolio image -->



      <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
      <p>Over the course of one full day, I ran a usability lab session with 7 participants. The usability session tested a combination of Android, iOS and responsive web, which uncovered some unknown features that the users were requesting, such as whether
        a health provider was even accepting new Medicaid patients. This insight allowed us to incorporate additional features into our MVP as well as fast add ons in subsequent releases. Another problem area the test uncovered was around use of language
        or tone within the app. We were then able to bring a copy writer onboard to help set the tone for the app and make it more plain human language. </p>
